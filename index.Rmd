# **Introduction**

This website presents a neighborhood-level housing and demographic analysis developed in collaboration with **Builders of Hope CDC** to support community-centered housing strategies in Dallas.

The analysis examines long-term trends in population, income, housing stock, land use, and housing market dynamics to identify where affordability pressures, displacement risk, and opportunity intersect. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven insights that inform equitable development, housing preservation, and anti-displacement efforts.

Interactive visualizations and summary findings are provided for each study area to support decision-making by community development organizations, policymakers, and funders.



# **Study Areas**
 
1. **West Dallas**  
   A neighborhood experiencing advanced housing market pressure, rising property values, and declining renter presence.

2. **South Dallas**  
   A historically disinvested community approaching a critical market transition point amid accelerating housing market activity.
