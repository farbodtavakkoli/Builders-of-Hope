# Builders of Hope – Neighborhood Housing & Demographic Analysis

This repository contains a longitudinal neighborhood-level analysis developed in collaboration with **Builders of Hope CDC** to support community-centered housing strategies in Dallas.

The analysis examines long-term trends in population, income, housing stock, land use, and housing market dynamics to identify where affordability pressures, displacement risk, and opportunity intersect. Findings are intended to support equitable development, housing preservation, and data-informed decision-making.

## Project Purpose

Builders of Hope CDC works to create and preserve affordable housing while preventing displacement in historically underserved communities. This project was developed to provide a clear, data-driven understanding of neighborhood change across selected Dallas areas and to support proactive housing interventions.

Specifically, this analysis aims to:
- Identify long-term demographic and housing trends
- Assess housing affordability and market pressure
- Highlight displacement risk and stabilization opportunities
- Support mission-driven housing development and preservation efforts

## Study Areas

### West Dallas
West Dallas represents a neighborhood experiencing advanced housing market pressure, characterized by rising property values, declining renter presence, and a shift toward higher-value, owner-occupied housing.

### South Dallas
South Dallas represents a historically disinvested community approaching a critical market transition point, where long-standing economic vulnerability intersects with accelerating housing market activity.

## Data & Methodology Overview

The analysis integrates multiple decades of publicly available data to assess neighborhood change over time, including:

- Population and demographic characteristics
- Income distribution and poverty indicators
- Housing tenure and household composition
- Land use patterns and housing stock
- Housing market activity (sales, prices, construction)

Trends are analyzed longitudinally to distinguish structural change from short-term market fluctuations.
